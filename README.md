# webquire
Modifies the behavior of require function to allow the client to use web modules.
I recommend you to put this onto your autoexec folder.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raycast6000/webquire/main/main.luau"))()
```
# Examples
This is the module that we want to require.
